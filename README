This is a python module that provides a nice, python-ish interface to Bugzilla
over XMLRPC.

It was originally written specifically for Red Hat's Bugzilla instance, but
now supports the Web Services provided by upstream Bugzilla 3.0 and 3.2 also.

It also includes a 'bugzilla' commandline client which can be used for quick, 
ad-hoc bugzilla jiggery-pokery. I guess you could use it in shell scripts too,
but gosh - why not just write something in Python instead?

Install with:
   sudo python setup.py install -O1

Comments, suggestions, and - most of all - patches are welcomed and encouraged.

Enjoy.
